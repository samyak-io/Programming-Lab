### Primality Testing

#### 1. Nth composite number

#### 2. Largest co-prime subset sum
f(10) = 30. {1,5,7,8,9}

#### Implement it in rust
Tips: look at methods, understand them, then write it from first principles without looking at it again


#### How does memory work in hardware?
Cache
Ram
HardDrive

food for thought: Registers in CPU

#### Problem of Paging
you have limited RAM, how long do yo keep stuff in RAM?
when someone asked for some information, and it's not in the ram then it's called a page miss.
Postgres ->  look at professor's codebases on page miss bit
whle it is doing all that, it's maintaining a stack and heap.

local variables and things related to a single function are stored in the stack.
things that persist are generally in the heap.


Later on we'll do concurrent and systems programming.
SwapSpace in linux.
